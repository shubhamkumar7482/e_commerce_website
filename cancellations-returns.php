               You as a customer can cancel your order till the order has been shipped by calling our customer service and not more than 24 hours after placing the order. In such a case we will refund any payments already made by you for the order and the same will be transferred to your bank account in 5-7 working days once we process your refund. If we suspect any fraudulent transaction by any customer or any transaction which defies the terms & conditions of using the website, we at our sole discretion could cancel such orders. We will maintain a negative list of all fraudulent transactions and customers and would deny access to them or cancel any orders placed by them.
